puts "some text\nmore text";    # some text
                                # more text
puts "\tOnce upon a time";      # "     Once upon a time"
puts "Juliet said \"Goodbye\" to Romeo"; # Juliet said "Goodbye" to Romeo
# for the single quote, it does the same
puts 'Julit said \'Goodbye\' to Romeo'; # Juliet said 'Goodbye' to Romeo

# also you can use this solution 
puts 'Juliet said "Goodbye" to Romeo';
puts "Juliet said 'Goodbye' to Romeo";


# you recommend to use double quot when using the string, single quote for character
